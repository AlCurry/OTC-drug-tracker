# OTC-drug-tracker

## Group Project #3 for GWU Bootcamp March 2018
### Chandler Dibble, Nicole Yoon, Al Curry, Tim Hill, Adam Specker

# Overview
* a project intended to help consumers find and keep track of over-the-counter drugs they've used
* why? either a young person who doesn't take medicine much or an old person who takes a lot
    * they need to know what's out there, and they need to know what they've taken
* what? an MVC model app using a database and the FDA open api to allow users to:
    * keep track of their OTC medication use, with easy access to information about those drugs
        * set those medications to active or inactive, with data logged based on time of administration
    * search the open FDA api for the right OTC drug for you
